Airline Systems with PARS-integration

The airline reservation system is a mission critical system that provides a complete hosting system for 
airlines. The airline systems also provide airline management assistance by addressing financial, 
administrative, back office issues, scheduling, airline load data, decision support for control of overbooking, 
discount seat allocations, and yield management that can be used to adjust the number of special fare seats 
based on the number of reservations.
 PARS (Programmed Airline Reservation Systems) are large scale airline reservation systems that executes under the control of IBM 
airline control program and its successor. PARS is the essential foundation and conceptual basis of all 
airline reservation systems. PARS-IPARS systems make use of the processed reservation and booking 
requests during allotments which ensures that all data can be stored and received easily.

 Justification:
The proposed and implemented system intends to solve online air booking and reservation problems to 
prevent disasters that causes a lot of queuing and chaos in countries which are in Africa. The fact that the 
proposed system uses a web based hierarchy with a relational airline database system to retrieve flights 
booking information and air tickets resolves the problems of inaccurate airline ticket booking by the manual 
system being refactored to an automatic software system, which can add/update passenger registration 
queries and allocates passengers different flight aircrafts in the case of double seat booking which assists 
to prevent duplicity and counterfeit. The system when refactored the passenger can update all their travel 
information in case of any changes made in their itinerary details to make a booking and receiving air 
tickets early for ease of travel purposes with all appropriate flight information and details with correct 
flight times that a passenger can easily adapt to and can be updated in the online airline database.
Multiple Airlines provide different iterative information such as online registration of passengers, the 
inclusion of travel maps, the booking plans, ergonomics of the plane, which improve the system interaction
of passenger with the system to prevent flight cancellations by reducing the time taken in receiving air
tickets. Refactoring the previous manual version of the system to an automatic online version ensures that 
there is data consistency maintained with different access modes by phones, by web, at the information 
desk and across different physical locations of the Multiple Airline Offices, maintains customer information 
in case of emergency, e.g. flight cancellation due to inclement weather and the system allocates a different 
flight aircraft, minimizing the number of vacant seats on a flight to maximize flight capacity utilization.
This reduces the effort and frustration of travellers in scheduling a trip, by reducing the search effort for 
the flight they need to catch. This inturn improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the refactored online 
air database and makes travelling ergonomic due to appropriate services provided by the system airlines
Functional Requirements
.Universal Online Login
The user need to login to the online database before they are granted the required services, the user had 
created an online Airline account with valid credentials ,the passenger can book flights to distinct locations 
and make changes to the required fields of data.
 Making Reservations and Cancellation of Reservations.
The user first creates an account to login, then logs in. The user then checks the flight details and makes 
payments to book a reservation and then logs out. The user then waits for the booking tickets.
 Payment Methods via Paypal
The User logs in with all their valid credit card details to make payments via the credit card for the flight 
that the passenger booked and receives a confirmation of payment.

 Non-Functional Requirements
 Interoperability.The web application is designed with an interface that is compatible with 
every operating system(android, windows, mac)
 Portability. The web- based application is developed to work in various computer 
environments such as computers, mobiles, tablets, laptops and electronic devices.
 Security. When the user creates an account , the password created is encrypted and saved 
before data is stored in the account.
User-Friendly. The layout is designed such that it is easy to be used by passengers across 
different ages.
