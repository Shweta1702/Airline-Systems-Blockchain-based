Airline Systems with Programmed Airline Reservation Systems-integration

The implemented system can solve the problem by refactoring its manual nature to automatic to add passenger details in the correct databases to 
resolve wrong seat allocation and can also allocate other Flight Aircraft vessels when the 
passenger changes their destinations , departure times this in turn reduces the losses the firm may 
encounter due to flight rescheduling and cancellation
Refactoring manual file inventories to automatic software air databases requires a lot of skill, expertise and 
money to prevent the risk of software failures like the one of British Airways in the year 2019 (despite of 
being an automated system the British Airways was forced to revert to a manual system that caused long 
queues at Heathrow, Gatwick and London city airports this led to loads of errors in the filing and database 
records-led to loss of information and jobs of airstaff due to inability of the firm to repay its passengers 
their money and struck of millions of jobs of the airstaff causing major losses in the airline industry (World, 
2018). The proposed system of multiple airlines is designed to prevent major losses in the airline industry,
create jobs for airstaff and prevents data loss, as well as, prevents loss of data from major identification 
documents, such as passport numbers, names, sensitive stakeholder information such as credit card details
The airline reservation system is a mission critical system that provides a complete hosting system for 
airlines. The airline systems also provide airline management assistance by addressing financial, 
administrative, back office issues, scheduling, airline load data, decision support for control of overbooking, 
discount seat allocations, and yield management that can be used to adjust the number of special fare seats 
based on the number of reservations.
 PARS (Programmed Airline Reservation Systems) are large scale airline reservation systems that executes under the control of IBM 
airline control program and its successor. PARS is the essential foundation and conceptual basis of all 
airline reservation systems. PARS-IPARS systems make use of the processed reservation and booking 
requests during allotments which ensures that all data can be stored and received easily.

 Justification:
The proposed and implemented system intends to solve online air booking and reservation problems to 
prevent disasters that causes a lot of queuing and chaos in countries which are in Africa. The fact that the 
proposed system uses a web based hierarchy with a relational airline database system to retrieve flights 
booking information and air tickets resolves the problems of inaccurate airline ticket booking by the manual 
system being refactored to an automatic software system, which can add/update passenger registration 
queries and allocates passengers different flight aircrafts in the case of double seat booking which assists 
to prevent duplicity and counterfeit. 
Artificial intelligence is a key technology that works with the global distribution systems that promotes easy 
facilitation of booking tickets. The four major GDS systems due to which systems are accessible to 
consumers through internet gateways for airline tickets include: SABRE, AMADEUS, GALILEO,
WORLDSPAN. The American airline use the SABRE reservation system that uses the interface PEGASUS 
that allows the passengers to obtain flight information and makes flight reservations and online payments 
through (credit cards) via large online dynamic databases that are accessed through: their personal 
computers and smartphones( without the risk of identity theft and fraud over the internet) (SABRE, 
2019).Biometrics ensure that payments are made securely via credit cards that use search algorithms to 
perform the search of airlines with some intelligence and some security that prevents credit card theft in 
payments. The biometric system lacks intelligence and smartness in searching of airlines where again the 
burden falls on the user towards refining the search, making decision based on retrieved results. Therefore,
the system works with the GDS internet gateways Intelligent Search Agent with learning capability 
(artificial intelligence) that may be searching for a flight with minimal individual preferences based on 
previous search experience of the agent.
The system when refactored the passenger can update all their travel 
information in case of any changes made in their itinerary details to make a booking and receiving air 
tickets early for ease of travel purposes with all appropriate flight information and details with correct 
flight times that a passenger can easily adapt to and can be updated in the online airline database.
Multiple Airlines provide different iterative information such as online registration of passengers, the 
inclusion of travel maps, the booking plans, ergonomics of the plane, which improve the system interaction
of passenger with the system to prevent flight cancellations by reducing the time taken in receiving air
tickets.
Refactoring the previous manual version of the system to an automatic online version ensures that 
there is data consistency maintained with different access modes by phones, by web, at the information 
desk and across different physical locations of the Multiple Airline Offices, maintains customer information 
in case of emergency, e.g. flight cancellation due to inclement weather and the system allocates a different 
flight aircraft, minimizing the number of vacant seats on a flight to maximize flight capacity utilization.
This reduces the effort and frustration of travellers in scheduling a trip, by reducing the search effort for 
the flight they need to catch. This inturn improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the refactored online 
air database and makes travelling ergonomic due to appropriate services provided by the system airlines.

Specific Objectives
i. To propose a system which can accurately store all passenger details safely in an online database 
in which more than one passenger data entries can be added, deleted and updated in less time 
accurately and efficiently.
ii. To design and develop a system with which passengers can view and obtain flight information of all 
domestic and international flights from appropriate flight databases online with all necessary flight 
details to make a flight reservation and booking .
iii. To implement a web based air reservation system with online booking and reservation forms 
designed and developed with Hypertext Markup Language to store large amounts of data with 
connections with online databases to store large amounts of passenger details and their itinerary 
information with which passengers can receive tickets online after having made payments online .

Functional Requirements:
Universal Online Login
The user need to login to the online database before they are granted the required services, the user had 
created an online Airline account with valid credentials ,the passenger can book flights to distinct locations 
and make changes to the required fields of data.

 Making Reservations and Cancellation of Reservations.
The user first creates an account to login, then logs in. The user then checks the flight details and makes 
payments to book a reservation and then logs out. The user then waits for the ticket allocations.

 Payment Methods via Paypal
The User logs in with all their valid credit card details to make payments via the credit card for the flight 
that the passenger booked and receives a confirmation of payment.
